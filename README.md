# Trading Chatbot using Blockchain and AI

The cryptocurrency exchange is a very tedious and technical task; layman man is not able to predict the right trade. The main goal of this project is to combine blockchain and AI to build a trading chatbot that is user friendly, automates next day trade prediction and is highly secure. Blockchain implementation can be assisted or enhanced via various AI
techniques.
When combined with natural language processing (NLP) — the ability for a computer to recognize and process human language data — blockchain is particularly potent. With NLP, information can be written and interpreted without a human. Adding AI to the prediction process makes trade prediction highly efficient. AI based trading bot will trade
cryptocurrency on exchange, such as bittrex, using strategies to maximize profit while reducing risk. This AI Network is an adaptive, self-optimising and interoperable “Blockchain 3.0” solution that supports smart contracts and machine learning services.


## Exchange marketplaces supported

## Basic Usage

The major expected outcome of this project is to combine blockchain and AI to build a trading chatbot that is user friendly, has efficient in predicting the next day trade and is highly secure.

Applying Long short term memory (LSTM) and Genetic Algorithm to predict the
market winning profitable trades is quite effective. Also, they improve security quite a lot.

Combining AI and blockchain can make trading cryptocurrency as easy as saying, “/start”.Within a social network, we have an established communication channel with the people we trust. We could get our banking done by chatting to a bot and have the certainty (provided by blockchain) that our transactions are absolutely secure.

Integrating AI and blockchain technologies into a single application will bring the distributed ledger technology down to making blockchain smarter and adding its ability to evolve through self- learning without the need to introduce AI as a separate technology.

Encryption and decryption is done on the client side, so nothing of value ever touches the chatbot server.
